"""Short claim-check handles for signed download URLs.

A self-contained signed JWT URL is enormous — a Gmail ``attachmentId`` alone
runs ~300 characters, pushing the full URL past 600 characters (~250 LLM
tokens every time it passes through the model). This module implements the
claim-check alternative: the claims that would have been signed into the JWT
are stored server-side in the shared KV store, keyed by a random 128-bit
handle, and the URL carries only the handle (~22 chars): ``/dl/{handle}``.

The handle *is* the capability: 128 bits from a CSPRNG is as unguessable as
an HMAC signature, the store's TTL enforces the same expiry the JWT would
have carried, and — unlike a JWT — a handle can be revoked by deleting the
row. Records are Fernet-encrypted under a handle-specific derived key
(salt ``workspace-download-handles``), mirroring the attachment credential
cache's pattern with its own context.

Backed by the shared ``WORKSPACE_MCP_OAUTH_PROXY_*`` backend (Valkey or
Postgres) when configured; falls back to an in-process store, which works
single-container. Multi-replica deployments need the shared backend — but
they already do, for credential recovery. When no store is usable at all,
``store_download_ref`` returns None and the caller falls back to the
self-contained JWT URL, which always works.
